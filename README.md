P.S. This model is not for commercial use but for self-study only. It was a pretty old project for studying SolidWorks at first, and I did not realize I would ever post them online, so the sources of a few opensource models are now no where to be found. It's here only for demonstration purposes. I'll try to remove those but please do not download if they are uploaded by mistake and notify me once you found any.
